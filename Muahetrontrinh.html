                <h2>What is the Mua he tron trinh notebook?</h2>
                <h3>Rolling Summer is an admixture of a picture book and daily journal made out of 40 ideas whose aspiration is to create a story to guide and accompany you on your summer adventure. In the first place, the ideas supposedly ignite the summer experiences and conjure up the reminiscence of childhood where we can find the playful spirit of children. Hence, they will connect with summer in their inner mind, where you can connect with the child within you and practice the playful spirit in every moment to fulfill happiness.</h3>
                <h3>Every day, turn a page of your notebook, write down the date in the footer to mark your journey, and create your answer from the available ideas by writing, drawing, collaging,.. Each page in Rolling Summer is a work of your own making.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    Besides, the creativity brought by Rolling Summer is not solely limited to the page – but also employed to engender ideas for both your living space and your development journey.

                <h2>The mission of Mua he tron trinh</h2>
                <h3>Mua he tron trinh notebook is indeed building two parallel stories. One is created by Seesaw, about the journey of a dot. The character of a dot acts as a guide for users to tell their own stories – which makes each notebook a distinctive piece of work.</h3>
                <h3>The ideas within the Mua he tron trinh notebook initially refer to the experiences that are normally deemed as “perfect”, then, the notebook questions the little things that can break your perfect circle, and finally leads you to explore ways of enjoying little happiness. All of the suggestions link to the summer theme and thus, evoke senses of childhood and the state of being playful. From there, you will be connected with summer in your mind, where you can touch your inner child and “see your moments” within little daily blissfulness.</h3>
                <div class="aboutp1-img">
                    <img src="img/project1-15.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Why do we need crowdfunding?</h2>
                <h3>Mua he tron trinh is more than a normal notebook with the usual note-taking and drawing functions. Accompanying throughout the chapters: Midsummer Night’s Dream, Summer and the Rains, and Finding the Lost Time, the book promisingly offers users not only enjoyable content but also a phenomenal experience towards its physical materials, stimulating and directly unlocking new chances to create.</h3>
                <h3>In particular, Mua he tron trinh notebook requires a high level of printing and manual laboring for the best experience. Each notebook would include specially designed pages with pop-up elements and supplementary accessories. The spine of the notebook is embroidered with thread and printed on high-quality paper.</h3>
                <h3>Furthermore, on launching Mua he tron trinh, Seesaw entered a new market in addition to our debut product – the board game market. Currently, in Vietnam, a product with such a sophisticated special design, together with a costly manual processing fee like Mua he tron trinh would be overpriced to the audience who are in need. Thus, we would like to raise crowdfunding with the hope of making Mua he tron trinh a unique high-qualified Vietnamese product, contributing to everyone’s creative and explorative journey.</h3>
